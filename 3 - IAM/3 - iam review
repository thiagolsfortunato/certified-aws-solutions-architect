IAM Consist of the Following:

Users
Groups
Roles
Policies

Whast differences between IAM Users and IAM Roles ?

The primary purpose of an IAM User is for authentication - proving to AWS that you are who you say you are. Once a user is authenticated, 
they generally should be given permissions by being added to one or more Groups - Polices (which contain the permissions) are assigned to Groups,
 and Users are made members of Groups.
Roles work very differently. Policies can be assigned to Roles, just as they are assigned to Groups - but Roles are not Groups.
Roles are like a mask or a badge that we apply to other, authenticated, security principals who want to access resources in our account. These 
other principals - or Trusted Entities, as they are referred to when configuring a Role - dont have an IAM User in our AWS account, so we can't add 
them to any of our Groups. The policies/permissions assigned to the Role are inherited by the Trusted Entity that the Role has been applied to.
Unlike the many-to-many relationship between Users and Groups, only one Role may be applied to a Trusted Entity at a time. If a Role is applied to 
an IAM User's connection to AWS, the Role permissions override any other permissions the User would normally have.
