Storage Gateway:
  - Service that connects an on-primises software appliance with cloud-based storage.
  - The service enable you to securely store data to the AWS cloud for scalable and cost-effective storage.
  - Available to download as a VM image that you can install on a host in your datacenter, suports Hyper-V and VMWare ESXi.
  Once installed your gateway and associate with your AWS account through the activation process, you can use the AWS Console
  to create the Storage Gateway.

Types:
  - File Gateway:
    - Files storage in S3 Bucket, accessed through Network File System (NFS) mount point.
    - Ownership, permissions in the user-metadata of the object associated with a file.
    - After transfered to S3, you can management using S3 Policies such versioning, lifecycle and cross-region replication.
  
  - Volumes Gateway:
    - Volume interface presents your applications with disks volumes using iSCSI block protocol.
    - Data writen can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, and stored in the cloud as
    Amazon EBS snapshots
    - Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks. All snapshot storage are compressed to minimize 
    your storage charges.
  
    - Stored Volumes:
      - Allow to store primary data locally, while asynchronously backing up data to AWS.
      - Stored Volumes provide your on-premisse applications low-latency access to their entire datasets, while provide durable,
      off-site backups.
      - Can create Storage Volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premisses storage hardware.
      - This data is asynchronously backed up to S3 in the form of EBS snapshots.
      - 1GB until 16TB in size for Stored Volumes
    
    - Cache Volumes:
      - Using S3 as your primary data storage while retain frequently accessed data locally in your Storage Gateway.
      - Minimize the need to scale your on-premisse storage infrastructure, while provides your low-latency access for
      frequently accessed data. 
      - You can create Storage Volume up to 32TiB and attach to them as iSCSI from your on-premisse application servers.
      - Your Gateway write data to theses volumes in S3 and retains recently read data in your on-premisse storage gateway Cache
      and upload buffer storage.
      - 1GB until 32TB in size for Cached Volume

  - Gateway Virtual Tape Library (VTL):
    - Durable, cost-effective solution to archive your data.
    - The VTL interface provides lets you improve your existing tape-based backup application infrastructure to store
    data on virtual tapes that you create your tape gateway.
    - Each Virtual Tape is preconfigured with media changer and tapes drives, which are available to your existing client
    backup application as iSCSI devices.
    - You can add tape cartridges as you need to archive your data.
    - Supported by NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam etc..
