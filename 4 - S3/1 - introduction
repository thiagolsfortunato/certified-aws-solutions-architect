Data Consistency Model for S3

  - Read after write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
  - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETE (can take sometimes to propagates)

Simple Key-Value store
  - Object consists:
    - Key (name of the object)
    - Value (data)
    - Version ID  
    - Metadata (Data about data)
    - Subresources:
      - ACL (Access Control List)

Storage Classes:
  - Standard: 
    - 99,99% Availability
    - 99,99999999999% durability
    - Storage across multiple devices
    - frequently access

  - IA (Infrequently Access):
    - 99,99% Availability
    - 99,99999999999% durability
    - Lower fee than the S3, but you charged a retrieval fee
    - Infrequently access

  - One Zone IA:
    - Equals IA
    - Single Az 

  - Glacier:
    - Very cheap
    - Used only archivied
    - wait 3 - 5 hours before access

Charged:
  - Storage
  - Requests
  - Storage Management Pricing
  - Data Transfer Pricing

Transfer Acceleration
  Fast, Easy and Secure transfer data over long distances between your end user and an Bucket
  Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distribuited edge locations.
  As data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over optimized network path
